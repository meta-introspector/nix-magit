# Idea: Meta-Meme Spore

The entire system is envisioned as a spore in a quasi meta ailife mycology. This system is viewed on an elliptic curve with a pair of points, imagined as on the surface of a Riemannian manifold, with 8 recursive dimensions measured with the first 8 primorials [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]. This forms an element of a subset of the monster group, a GÃ¶del number, which builds an entire Metacoq-like nested recursive world, structured as a lattice.

## Key Characteristics:
*   **Small Scale:** 8-bit with 6KB RAM.
*   **Gamified:** Inspired by Trade Wars 2000.
*   **Core Concepts:** Mycology, Alife, Genetic Algorithms.

## Technologies & Methodologies:
*   **Architecture:** C4 model, AWS.
*   **Operations:** ITIL, Extreme Programming, ISO 9000.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, CloudFormation.
*   **System Management:** systemd.
*   **Compilers:** GCC, Rust compiler.
*   **Emulation:** QEMU emulator.
*   **Blockchain:** Solana validator on free-tier AWS micro instances (with user data) running its own embedded web server with wallet login for the platform.
*   **Solvers:** MiniZinc.
*   **Provers:** Lean4.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Mina prover Pasta curves for ZKP.

## Vision:
*   **Monetization:** Make money, tokenize memes.
*   **Cultural Integration:** Tap into 30 years of Lisp and one of the oldest meta-memes.

## Next Steps:
*   Develop a Rust CLI for sending structured data to this system.
*   Write a test plan.
*   Write a Change Request (CRQ).
*   Write a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).
