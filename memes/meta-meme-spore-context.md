# Meta-Meme Spore System Context and Open Questions

This document captures the current understanding and open questions regarding the "Meta-Meme Spore" system, intended for recursive optimization using MiniZinc, AI, LLMs, custom alife, genetic algorithms, and meta-memes.

## Current Understanding:

*   The entire system is envisioned as a spore in a quasi meta ailife mycology, viewed on an elliptic curve with a pair of points on a Riemannian manifold.
*   It features 8 recursive dimensions measured with the first 8 primorials [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19].
*   It's an element of a subset of the monster group, a Gödel number, building a Metacoq-like nested recursive world, structured as a lattice.
*   **Small Scale:** 8-bit with 6KB RAM.
*   **Gamified:** Inspired by Trade Wars 2000.
*   **Core Concepts:** Mycology, Alife, Genetic Algorithms.
*   **Technologies & Methodologies:** C4 model, AWS, ITIL, Extreme Programming, ISO 9000, Terraform, CloudFormation, systemd, GCC compiler, Rust compiler, QEMU emulator, Solana validator on free-tier AWS micro instances (with user data) running its own embedded web server with wallet login for the platform, MiniZinc for solver, Lean4 for prover, Mina prover Pasta curves for ZKP.
*   **Vision:** Make money, tokenize memes, tap into 30 years of Lisp and one of the oldest meta-memes.
*   **GCC Compiler Role:** The GCC compiler will be linked into the system as an instance of the meta-memes.

## Open Questions for Defining the Meta-Meme Spore System for MiniZinc Optimization

To effectively model and optimize aspects of the "Meta-Meme Spore" system using MiniZinc, and to leverage AI, LLMs, custom alife, genetic algorithms, and meta-memes in a recursive problem-solving approach, we need to clarify several foundational elements.

### 1. System Definition and Dimensionality

*   **1.1. Interpretation of Primorial Dimensions:** How do the "8 recursive dimensions measured with the first 8 primorials [2,3,5,7, 11,13,17,19]" translate into quantifiable system parameters or states?
    *   Are these dimensions independent or interdependent?
    *   Do the primorials represent weights, capacities, or some other metric for each dimension?
    *   How does "recursion" manifest in these dimensions? Is it a nested hierarchy, iterative process, or something else?

*   **1.2. "Spore in Quasi Meta Ailife Mycology":** How can we model the "spore" and "mycology" aspects?
    *   What are the quantifiable characteristics of a "spore" (e.g., initial state, growth potential, resource requirements)?
    *   How does the "mycology" (network/growth) influence the system's state or resource distribution?
    *   What are the rules for "ailife" and "genetic algorithms" within this context? What are their objectives (e.g., survival, propagation, optimization of a specific metric)?

*   **1.3. "Monster Group" and "Gödel Number":** How do these abstract mathematical concepts concretely influence the system's behavior or state space for optimization?
    *   Are they defining symmetries, state transitions, or encoding specific rules/constraints?
    *   Can we derive quantifiable properties or constraints from these concepts for the MiniZinc model?

### 2. Resource Constraints and Allocation

*   **2.1. 8-bit with 6KB RAM:** How is this 6KB RAM distributed or utilized across the 8 dimensions and various system components (e.g., alife, genetic algorithms, embedded webserver, Solana validator)?
    *   Are there minimum/maximum RAM allocations per component/dimension?
    *   What are the performance implications of RAM allocation choices?

*   **2.2. AWS Free-Tier Micro Instances:** What are the specific constraints and capabilities of these instances that need to be considered in resource allocation (e.g., CPU, network I/O, storage)?
    *   How does the "user data" aspect play into the initial configuration and resource usage?

### 3. Optimization Goals and Metrics

*   **3.1. "Make Money" and "Tokenize Memes":** How do we quantify "making money" and "tokenizing memes" as objective functions or constraints for MiniZinc?
    *   What defines a "successful" meme tokenization? (e.g., virality, value, reach, resource efficiency)?
    *   What are the inputs and outputs of the meme tokenization process?
    *   How do "meta-memes" influence this process?

*   **3.2. "Lisp and Oldest Meta Memes":** How can the "30 years of Lisp" and "oldest meta memes" be integrated into the optimization?
    *   Are they a source of rules, patterns, or a knowledge base for the AI/LLM components?
    *   Do they define specific states or desired outcomes?

### 4. Interoperability and Tool Integration

*   **4.1. Role of AI/LLMs:** How will AI/LLMs interact with the MiniZinc model and the overall system?
    *   Will they generate MiniZinc models, interpret results, or provide inputs/constraints based on meta-meme analysis?
    *   How do they contribute to the "recursive" problem-solving?

*   **4.2. Custom Alife and Genetic Algorithms:** What are the specific roles and objectives of these components in the optimization loop?
    *   Are they evolving MiniZinc models, generating data, or exploring solution spaces?
